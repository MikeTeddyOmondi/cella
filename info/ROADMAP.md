# Roadmap
We maintain a very rough roadmap here. Its a work in progress and things will get added, removed and changed. We will eventually manage a roadmap elsewhere.
Last update: July 8,2024

## ðŸ“… &nbsp; Current projects
* [imado.eu](imado.eu) for file handling
* A customizable, extendable permission system
* Blog section

## ðŸ§ª &nbsp; Testing
* Vitest + Playwright + Storybook [https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/1561](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/1561)
* Automated security audit / testing solution
* Perf testing with K6 / Grafana

# Community involvement
Some things we would love to include in cella, but they are beyond the scope/resources to be done by our own team. If you are interested in working on any of these, please let us know ([info@cellajs.com](mailto:info@cellajs.com)). We are open to funding it as an OSS project, if you will be using cella to build a service for it in the EU.

## Embedded analytics
Being able to embed dashboards for traffic and event analytics on multiple levels.
* app-wide
* per customer
* for end-users (ie. a teacher wants to see the activity of its students)

## ðŸ“± &nbsp; Native mobile/desktop app
* [Expo](https://expo.dev/) or [CapacitorJS](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) (OS) for native apps
* [Electron-Vite](https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-react) or [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) or [ToDesktop](https://www.todesktop.com/) for desktop app

## European Sendgrid/Resend alternative
We need a simple, robust transactional email service with dedicated IP option based and hosted in the EU.
